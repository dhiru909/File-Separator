# File-Separator
This can be used to separate files according to the file extension in that folder of extenstion like (jpg, pdf, cpp, mov etc...)

- copy this file "file-filter.py" in the folder that you want to organise and just run this python file
- if it did not work then run using administrator permission coz this needs to move file from one folder to another.
- hope you guys enjoy this....
